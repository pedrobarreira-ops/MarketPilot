# Deferred Work

Items deferred during code review. Each entry includes the review date and source story.

## Deferred from: code review of 1-1-project-scaffold (2026-04-16)

- **Add `test` script and test runner setup** — scaffold only per spec; runner decision belongs to first testing story in Epic 1.
- **Add lint/format scripts (ESLint + Prettier)** — project-level tooling decision, not scaffold-scope.
- **SQLITE_PATH directory writability pre-check** [src/config.js:24] — better-sqlite3 errors with clear SQLITE_CANTOPEN at runtime; fail-fast is nice-to-have.
- **NODE_ENV unknown-value warning** [src/config.js:20] — defensive check; not spec-required.
- **CTA_URL placeholder guard at deploy time** [public/js/report.js:4] — launch-checklist concern per UX-DR15.
- **Add `license` field to package.json** — add before any public release.
- **Strict Node version enforcement** (preinstall hook or `engine-strict=true` in .npmrc) [package.json] — `engines` is advisory but acceptable for internal scaffold.
- **Run `npm audit` on committed package-lock.json** — ops housekeeping; verify no transitive vulnerabilities before deploy.

## Deferred from: code review of 1-2-fastify-server-with-log-redaction (2026-04-17)

- **No SIGTERM/SIGINT handler for graceful shutdown** [src/server.js] — on Coolify/Docker `docker stop` sends SIGTERM; without a handler in-flight requests may be dropped. Out of scope for Story 1.2; address in Story 1.5 (Docker/Coolify deployment config).
- **No test for missing static file returning 404** [tests/server.atdd.test.js] — `@fastify/static` default 404 for missing files is not explicitly tested. Low priority; add to integration test suite in a later story.
- **`fastify.log.error(err)` on listen failure passes full error object** [src/server.js:61] — low-probability leak if startup error carries sensitive content; consider logging only `err.code`/`err.constructor.name`/`err.message` explicitly once startup error classes are known.
- **Exported `fastify` from `server.js` is side-effectful** [src/server.js:66] — top-level `await fastify.listen()` means importing the exported instance binds a port; current tests avoid via `buildApp()`. Pattern matches spec; revisit when a future story needs to import the instance without starting the server.
- **`errorApp` before() block duplicates `buildApp()` boilerplate** [tests/server.atdd.test.js:195-238] — DRY violation; `buildApp()` could accept a routes-setup callback. No correctness impact; refactor in a future test maintenance pass.
- **Missing `public/` dir causes unhandled rejection at container start** [src/server.js:37-40] — `@fastify/static` plugin registration runs at module-eval time via top-level ESM await, bypassing the `try/catch` around `listen()`. Add a `fs.existsSync(PUBLIC_DIR)` pre-check or handle in Docker build to ensure `public/` is always present.

## Deferred from: code review of 2-1-keystore-module (2026-04-17)

- **`set()` accepts `undefined`/`null` jobId silently** [src/queue/keyStore.js:16] — pre-existing design choice; spec reference implementation omits guards. Caller responsibility; guard belongs in Story 4.1 route handler before calling `keyStore.set()`.
- **`set()` accepts falsy/null apiKey silently** [src/queue/keyStore.js:16] — pre-existing design choice; no AC requires validation. Guard belongs in Story 4.1 route handler (validate api_key is a non-empty string before `keyStore.set()`).

## Deferred from: code review of 3-1-mirakl-api-client-with-retry (2026-04-18)

- **No request timeout / AbortController on fetch** [src/workers/mirakl/apiClient.js:36] — a hung Mirakl response will block the worker indefinitely; story AC does not require it. Add a configurable timeout (e.g. 30s) via `AbortController` once report-worker SLOs are defined (Epic 3 follow-up).
- **`apiKey = undefined/null` silently sent as header value** [src/workers/mirakl/apiClient.js:29] — no input validation. `keyStore` contract currently guarantees non-null via Story 2.1, so deferred. Worth a 1-line invariant check if apiClient is ever reused outside the report pipeline.
- **`res.json()` SyntaxError on malformed body escapes unwrapped** [src/workers/mirakl/apiClient.js:52] — a 2xx response with invalid JSON currently throws a raw `SyntaxError` instead of `MiraklApiError`, and is not retried. Mirakl production always returns JSON, so low priority. Consider wrapping `res.json()` in try/catch and throwing `MiraklApiError(503)` to give callers a uniform error type.

## Deferred from: code review of 3-2-of21-catalog-fetch-with-pagination (2026-04-18)

- **No max-iteration guard on pagination `while(true)` loop** [src/workers/mirakl/fetchCatalog.js:50] — end-of-results signal relies solely on `pageOffers.length < PAGE_SIZE`. A buggy API that keeps returning exactly 100 offers while `total_count` stays low could theoretically loop indefinitely. Low-risk for MVP scale; consider adding `if (offset > total_count + PAGE_SIZE) throw ...` once `total_count` is known, or a hard cap on iterations (e.g. `offset > 10_000_000`).
- **`offer.applicable_pricing?.price` can be `undefined` and silently propagate** [src/workers/mirakl/fetchCatalog.js:114] — when an ACTIVE offer has no `applicable_pricing` block, the returned catalog entry will have `price: undefined` without triggering `CatalogTruncationError` (assertion is on count, not field completeness). Not covered by AC-5. Downstream consumers (Story 3.3 P11 competitor scan, Story 3.4 scoring) should validate or skip price-less entries.
